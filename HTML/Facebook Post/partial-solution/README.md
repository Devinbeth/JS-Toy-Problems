# Concept for New Toy Problems

The intro and medium folders are just random toy problems that I have collected but are not really part of my new plan specifically. Part of my goal with this is to eliminate "advanced toy problems" and make it so every problem will have a variety of approaches and ways to optimize them.

## Proposed Weekly Schedule

<li>Monday - Teaching topic/normal toy problem</li>
<li>Tuesday - Cart (Week 5 SQL Cart Schema)</li>
<li>Wednesday - HTML</li>
<li>Thursday - Broken Toy problem</li>
<li>Friday - Breakfast</li>

## HTML

The HTML has a few sites drawn with boxes around them progressing through how to build a layout and more importantly how to think in terms of boxes and sections. If you use this I would stress that they should really just use divs and not worry about the actual content but more the layout and how to position things.

## Cart

The idea of this one was to try and spend multiple days spread over a few weeks where they built something that felt more real and usable. Also this would help for when students want to build a cart and now you could have them pull up their toy problems for a starting point.

## Broken Problems

Everyone of these problems does not work. With each one you can solve it by only modifying existing lines, there is not a need to write more lines of code. This is could be a good starting place for teaching the students how to troubleshoot using the scientific method (more on this per request).

## Teaching topics

This is a list of topics I want to teach and to find a toy problem that focuses on teaching each one specifically. I just felt like our toy problems most of the time end up just being the same things over and over. This ensures variety.

This is in no way a compleat or finished list. if there is a () next to the title then it is a brief description of a toy problem that could help teach that topic. We should make it clear before hand what method or words they should search so they can do the toy problem.

<li>for loop to modify data (map)</li>
<li>nested objects/large objects (my bob ross family tree https://repl.it/@Rasbandit/Bob-Ross-Family-Tree-Test-Data)</li>
<li>working with an array of objects</li>
<li>while loop / do while</li>
<li>for in/square brackets (loop through every property)</li>
<li>for of (alternative for loop for arrays)</li>
<li>switch (looking for vowels)</li>
<li>if and / or (if male and 18)</li>
<li>higher order functions</li>
<li>double for loop</li>

## SQL Schema

Later in the I would like to do one or who Schema toy problem. So specifically how to build a table for the data you need. Not how to select from it. We spend enough time on how to get data, but not how to structure data.
